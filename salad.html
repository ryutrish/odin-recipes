Here are two recipes: one for a delicious biryani and another for a refreshing date milkshake!

Chicken Biryani Recipe
Ingredients:
For the Chicken Marinade:

500g chicken, cut into pieces
1 cup plain yogurt
2 onions, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
2-3 green chilies, slit
1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
2-3 tablespoons biryani masala (store-bought or homemade)
Salt to taste
Juice of 1 lemon
For the Rice:

2 cups basmati rice
4 cups water
2-3 whole cloves
2-3 green cardamoms
1-2 bay leaves
1 stick of cinnamon
Salt to taste
For Layering:

1/4 cup fried onions (store-bought or homemade)
Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (optional)
Additional mint and cilantro for garnish
Steps:
Marinate the Chicken:

In a large bowl, combine chicken pieces, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chopped tomatoes, green chilies, mint, cilantro, biryani masala, lemon juice, and salt. Marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the fridge for best results).
Cook the Rice:

Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add whole spices (cloves, cardamoms, bay leaves, and cinnamon) and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it's 70% cooked (the rice should still have a bite). Drain and set aside.
Cook the Chicken:

In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is tender and the oil separates from the masala (about 15-20 minutes).
Layer the Biryani:

In the pot with the cooked chicken, layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken. Drizzle the saffron milk over the top and sprinkle fried onions, mint, and cilantro.
Dum Cooking:

Cover the pot tightly with a lid (you can seal it with dough if you want) and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.
Serve:

Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Serve hot with raita or a side salad.
Date Milkshake Recipe
Ingredients:
1 cup milk (dairy or plant-based)
6-8 dates, pitted
1 banana (optional, for creaminess)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
A pinch of cinnamon (optional)
Ice cubes (optional, for a chilled shake)
Steps:
Prepare the Dates:

If the dates are hard, soak them in warm water for about 10 minutes to soften.
Blend the Ingredients:

In a blender, combine the milk, pitted dates, banana (if using), vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Blend until smooth.
Adjust Consistency:

If you prefer a thicker shake, add more dates or banana. For a thinner consistency, add more milk.
Serve:

Pour the milkshake into glasses. Add ice cubes if desired, and serve immediately.
This date milkshake is naturally sweet and nutritious, perfect as a snack or breakfast option!
